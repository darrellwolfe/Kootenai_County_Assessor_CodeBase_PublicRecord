If actual was:	
4	acres

 =(AI4-AI3) = 155.00 	

 =AN14/AN15 = 0.0258 	

=AJ3*AN16 = 645.1612	

=AJ3+AN17 = $25,645	

How do I build this whole thing into a single cell, referencing the table, and interpolating the results?? 


In cell AK26:
Subtract Acres to (AI3) from the line below (AI4)
Actual acres (AK26), divided by resut of the subtraction above. 
Take that result, divided by $/Acre amount (AJ3)
Add that result to the #/Acre amount (AJ3)


=((AJ3*(AE26/(AI3-AI4)))*-1)+AJ3

=(($AI$3*($AE26/($AH$4-$AH$3)))*-1)+$AI$3


Problem, if there were only two levels, this would be fine. However, there are not. Can I make this dynamic? Can I use arrays instead of a huge embded if formula?

ChatGPT:
    "Yes, the given formula can be converted into an array formula. Array formulas allow you to perform multiple calculations with one formula and return an array of results. To convert the given formula into an array formula, you can use the following steps:
    
    Step 1: Select a range of cells where you want the array results to be displayed.
    
    Step 2: Input the following formula as an array formula (Array formulas are entered by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER instead of just pressing ENTER):
    
    excel
    Copy code
    =IF($AE27>=AH$3:AH$8, IF($AE27<=AI$3:AI$8, $AJ$3:$AJ$8, ""), "")
    Please note that the above array formula assumes that the ranges AH3:AH8, AI3:AI8, and AJ3:AJ8 contain the conditions and values you want to compare with cell AE27.
    
    This array formula will return an array of values, with each element corresponding to the condition result for each row in the range $AE27:$AExx (where xx is the last row you want to apply the formula to). If the condition is met, it will return the corresponding value from $AJ$3:$AJ$8; otherwise, it will return an empty string ("").
    
    Keep in mind that array formulas can be resource-intensive, especially when dealing with large data ranges, so use them judiciously."

After two hours of research and back and forth, I got this far, not there yet, but closer. 

=IF(ISBLANK([@[Remain. Ac]]), "", IF([@[Remain. Ac]] >= INDEX($AH$2:$AH$8, COUNT($AH$2:$AH$8)), INDEX($AI$2:$AI$8, COUNT($AH$2:$AH$8)), INDEX($AI$2:$AI$8, MATCH([@[Remain. Ac]], $AH$2:$AH$8, 1))))


This version works IF the final boxes with no values in the reference array have text (N/A or seomthing like that) - But it only returns the array values ($25,000 for example). Now we need to add the interpolation... to this:
=IF(ISBLANK([@[Remain. Ac]]), "", IFERROR(IF([@[Remain. Ac]] >= INDEX($AH$2:$AH$8, COUNTA($AH$2:$AH$8)), INDEX($AI$2:$AI$8, COUNTA($AH$2:$AH$8)), INDEX($AI$2:$AI$8, MATCH([@[Remain. Ac]], $AH$2:$AH$8, 1))), ""))

--------------------------------------------------------------

I have a table in the array: $AH$2:$AI$8, AH is Acres and AI is $ Values. The following formula accurately reads a reference cell and produces the value from the AI column. So for 5.4320 acrs, I get $26,000. But, I need interpolated results. So it should be $25,899. Table "Acres from 	$/Acre NEW
 -   	$26,000
 5.00 	$26,000
 160.00 	$15,000

The formula you've shared uses linear interpolation to calculate the Value per acre, based on the given Acres. However, you're finding that it's producing a slightly different result than what you're expecting.

Without having the full dataset, it's a bit tricky to understand exactly what's going wrong. But here are some potential issues that might be causing the discrepancy:

Rounding errors: Excel can sometimes produce rounding errors when dealing with decimal numbers. It's possible that your actual data has more precision than what you're showing here, and those small differences can add up.

Data precision: The precision of your data can also play a role. If your Acres and Values per acre data have more decimal places than you're showing here, then that could be causing the discrepancy.

Interpolation method: It looks like you're using a form of linear interpolation, which assumes that the relationship between Acres and Value per acre is linear. But if the actual relationship is not linear, then the interpolation method could produce inaccurate results.

To pinpoint the exact issue, you would need to look at the full data set and understand more about the relationship between Acres and Value per acre.

Unfortunately, I can't provide an updated formula based on the information you've provided. But I would suggest checking the above potential issues first, and see if any of those might be causing the discrepancy. Also, if you have the exact function that is used to derive the $25,898.52 value, using that might lead to more accurate results.

What other Interpolation method could I use?
ChatGPT
If the relationship between acres and value per acre isn't linear, you could consider these other interpolation methods:

Polynomial Interpolation: This involves fitting a polynomial of a certain degree to your data. The order of the polynomial to use depends on your data, but the idea is to find the polynomial that best fits your data. Excel doesn't have a built-in function for this, so you would need to use a software that can perform polynomial interpolation, or code your own function.

Spline Interpolation: This is another method which involves fitting piecewise polynomials (splines) to the data. In the case of cubic splines, which is a common choice, you would fit a cubic polynomial between each pair of data points in such a way that the resulting curve is smooth and continuous. Like with polynomial interpolation, you'd need to use a software that can perform spline interpolation, or code your own function.

Logarithmic or Exponential Interpolation: If your data follows a logarithmic or exponential trend, you could use these methods. These methods are variations of linear interpolation, but with the data transformed so that the relationship becomes linear. Excel does not have built-in functions for these, but you can easily transform your data using built-in functions (LOG, EXP, etc.) and then use linear interpolation.

Nearest Neighbor Interpolation: In this method, the value of a point is assigned the value of the nearest data point. It's a simple method, but may not be accurate if your data isn't uniformly distributed.

Keep in mind that each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the best method to use depends on the nature of your data. The more complex methods, like polynomial and spline interpolation, can provide better accuracy, but they're also more computationally intensive and can be more difficult to implement.

It would be best to plot your data and inspect the trend visually. This can often give you a good idea of what interpolation method might be appropriate.

Using a target acre of 5.4320, and a table with 0 acres is $26,000, 5 acres is $26,000, $160 acres is $15,000, knowing the result should be $25,898.52. Can you attempt various methods to see which one comes closest? 
ChatGPT
Based on the data you provided, the piecewise linear interpolation method already seems to be quite suitable because the change from 0 to 5 acres does not result in a change in dollar per acre value, suggesting a flat rate for this range. However, the result you obtained was slightly off from your expectation.

In Excel, you can only use simple linear interpolation, as more complex methods like polynomial or spline interpolation require more advanced functions or programming.

Here, let's evaluate a linear interpolation method:

Between 0-5 acres, the rate is $26,000/acre. But you want to estimate for 5.4320 acres, which is over the 5-acre threshold, hence we must consider the rate change between 5 and 160 acres.

The rate of change (slope) between 5 acres and 160 acres is:

scss
Copy code
(26000 - 15000) / (5 - 160) = -75
Given that the acreage is 5.4320, the interpolated value would be calculated as follows:

makefile
Copy code
Value = 26000 - 75 * (5.4320 - 5)

Value = 26000 - 75 * 0.432 = $25968 
So, it seems like the simple linear interpolation might not be the perfect fit here if your expected result is $25,898.52, as there is still a small difference. This discrepancy suggests the relationship between acres and value per acre might not be strictly linear, or there could be other factors at play that aren't accounted for in a simple linear interpolation.

Without further information about how the data behaves or what other factors could influence the value per acre, it's hard to suggest an interpolation method that would yield your expected result. However, a more complex method like spline interpolation or polynomial interpolation might provide a better fit if the relationship isn't linear, but would likely require use of a statistical software or programming language that supports these methods.




User
Can you attempt Spline Interpolation to see what happens?
ChatGPT
As a text-based AI, I'm not equipped to perform computations like spline interpolation. But I can guide you on how to do it using Python, one of the most popular programming languages for data analysis.

For Python, we'll use the scipy library's interp1d function, which supports various types of interpolation, including cubic spline interpolation.

Here's how you might set up your program:

python
Copy code
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

# Define the known data points
acres = [0, 5, 160]
values_per_acre = [26000, 26000, 15000]

# Define the interpolation function
f = interp1d(acres, values_per_acre, kind='cubic')

# Use the function to estimate the value per acre at 5.4320 acres
estimated_value_per_acre = f(5.4320)

# Print the result
print(f"The estimated value per acre at 5.4320 acres is ${estimated_value_per_acre}")
To run this program, you would need to have Python and the scipy library installed on your computer. You can install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/), and then use the pip package manager (which comes with Python) to install scipy (pip install scipy).

Note: The cubic spline interpolation could potentially overfit to the data points and create an inaccurate estimate, especially when extrapolating outside the range of the known data points. Therefore, it's important to have a sense of the underlying relationship between acres and value per acre to choose the most appropriate interpolation method.

In Excel, you can use dollar signs ($) to lock references so they don't change when you copy and paste a formula.

Here is your formula with all the column and array references locked:

excel
Copy code
=INDEX($AI$3:$AI$8, MATCH(MAX(IF($AH$3:$AH$8<$AE26, $AH$3:$AH$8)), $AH$3:$AH$8, 0))
+ ($AE26 - MAX(IF($AH$3:$AH$8<$AE26, $AH$3:$AH$8)))
* (INDEX($AI$3:$AI$8, MATCH(MIN(IF($AH$3:$AH$8>$AE26, $AH$3:$AH$8)), $AH$3:$AH$8, 0))
- INDEX($AI$3:$AI$8, MATCH(MAX(IF($AH$3:$AH$8<$AE26, $AH$3:$AH$8)), $AH$3:$AH$8, 0)))
/ (MIN(IF($AH$3:$AH$8>$AE26, $AH$3:$AH$8)) - MAX(IF($AH$3:$AH$8<$AE26, $AH$3:$AH$8)))
With this, even if you drag or copy the formula to other cells, the ranges $AI$3:$AI$8 and $AH$3:$AH$8 and column $AE will always refer to the same cells.
