Note: In Power Query, we needed a seperate table per type. Rather than write different queries for a single filter, 
we just use this query and apply a single filter in Power Query. Once we kick the appraisers out of the worksheets,
and start doing REAL data analytics in Python, R, Tableau, and/or other tools, we won't need any of that.
Until then, we need to do it this way.
