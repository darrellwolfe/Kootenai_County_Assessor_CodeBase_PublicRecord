This Hangman exe is written from a script using my Wordnik API key. If you'd like a copy of it, then take the python script I wrote, copy it to your working dir, replace the API key with yours (you can request one from wordnik) and then use pyinstaller like this from terminal of VSC in the directory of the copy:

pyinstaller --onefile Hangman.py
