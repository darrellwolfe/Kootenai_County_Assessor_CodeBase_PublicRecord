Allocations Check
Compare parcels with allocations against an allocations key
I can't figure out how to use SQL to pull in the key without Python Pandos installed, and IT won't give us that yet. 
So I'm using 
(1) Power Query to pull in the Key as "connection only".
(2) then SQL to pull in the Allocations with PINs, but loading it to "connection only".
Finally, (3) Inside Power Query, Merge these two as new, matching on PCC and ImpGroupCode, loading
