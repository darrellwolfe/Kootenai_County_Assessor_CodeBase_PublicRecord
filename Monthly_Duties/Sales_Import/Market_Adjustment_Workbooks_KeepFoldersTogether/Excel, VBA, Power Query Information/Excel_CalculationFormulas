-- GPT-4 Suggestion:

Ah, I see the issue. The AVERAGE function cannot handle array formulas properly within an IF statement. Instead, use the AVERAGEIFS function for your use case. 

The AVERAGEIFS function calculates the average of a range based on multiple criteria. It requires the following arguments:

1. Average_range: The actual cells to average.
2. Criteria_range1: The range of cells you want evaluated by criterion1.
3. Criterion1: The condition that defines which cells in the criteria_range1 will be averaged.

Assuming that "Transfer Type" is not "M", you'll take the average of "Certified Value Total", and if "Transfer Type" is "M", you'll take the average of "MultiSale Certified TOTAL". 

You need to create two separate AVERAGEIFS functions and sum them up to get the total average. Here's how to do it:

```excel
=(AVERAGEIFS(GEO_[Certified Value Total], GEO_[Transfer Type], "<>M") + AVERAGEIFS(GEO_[MultiSale Certified TOTAL], GEO_[Transfer Type], "M")) / AVERAGE(GEO_[Last Year Time Adjusted Sale Price (TASP)])
```

This formula will calculate the average of the "Certified Value Total" where the transfer type is not "M", and the average of "MultiSale Certified TOTAL" where the transfer type is "M". It then adds these averages together. Finally, it divides this result by the average of "Last Year Time Adjusted Sale Price (TASP)".

This assumes that there is a row for every type of transfer, both "M" and not "M". If this is not the case, you may need to handle this situation to avoid dividing by zero.
