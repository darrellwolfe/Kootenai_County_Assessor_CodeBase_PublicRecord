Balancing Spreadsheet

Column M is from 2018 Estimated Year-End Values MM-DD-YY, column F, usually around the end of July
Column AG, Budget Amount, is from the Levy Rate Calculation Worksheets provided by the Auditor, usually at the end of Sept. CAREFUL on JOINT DISTRICTS
Tab RP Subroll from 2018 Supplemental RP Balance CR538 CL812 TR103 01-29-19 spreadsheet
Tab PP Sub Roll from 2018 Annual PP2 Balance CR541 CL815 TR104 01-22-19

PARTIAL INCREMENT
Partial increment shifts value from increment back to base. Using the 2020 Annual RP Full Balance as an example, the difference between column C, Cadastre District Taxable, and column P, Tax District Taxable, should be equal to the total of the partial increment for that Tax Authority.
P47 (231-School Dist #272J-Bond) – C47 = 1,989,058
Partial Increment for 231-School Dist #272J-Bond (C114) = 1,989,058
The same will hold true for R47-E47, (base) and F47 – S47 (Incr).
