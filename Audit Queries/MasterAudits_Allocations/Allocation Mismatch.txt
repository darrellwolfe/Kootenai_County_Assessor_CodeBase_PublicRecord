Allocations Mismatch requires a local excel file. The file (Allocations Key.xlsx) and a database query (Allocations_.sql).

In Power Query, 
- TRIM the Group Code and PCC code on both tables. 
- Starting with the dbQuery, MERGE AS NEW with the Allocations Key, match on Group Code and PCC Code, Left Anti (keep only those in the first table, not matching)
